# copilot.sh License FAQ

**Q: Can I use copilot.sh at home or at work?**  
Yes. You can run and modify it for yourself or your company.

**Q: Can I host copilot.sh for my team?**  
Yes, as long as it’s for your own internal use.

**Q: Can I sell copilot.sh as a SaaS?**  
No. Hosting copilot.sh as a paid service for others requires a commercial license from us.

**Q: Will this ever be “true” open source?**  
Yes. Each release converts to Apache 2.0 after four years.

**Q: Why BUSL instead of MIT/Apache?**  
We want to maximize adoption (you can run it freely) while preventing third parties from running a hosted clone. This protects our ability to fund development.
